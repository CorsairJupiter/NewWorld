  <summary>Weak Health Potion</summary> 
  
+ 1 Weak Alkahest 
+ 1 Water
  
</details> 

The syntax for this is below. 

```md 

<details> 
  <summary>Weak Health Potion</summary> 

+ 1 Weak Alkahest 
+ 1 Water
  
</details> 

``` 
> **Note** 
>
> All tags (`<details>`and `<summary>`) must be closed with either `</details>` or `</summary>`

Add the name of the item between `<summary` and `</summary>`. Add the ingredients below that.  

There is file that contains a template for this called *Collapsible Text Template*.
